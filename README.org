* =battle-haxe= - a new weapon for your Emacs

A development system for the Haxe programming language.

[[file:battle-haxe.png]]

Battle-haxe adds code-completion and IDE-like features when editing Haxe code, provided by the\\
Haxe compiler's [[https://haxe.org/manual/cr-completion-overview.html]["compiler services"]] feature in server mode.

See [[https://github.com/AlonTzarafi/battle-haxe#installation][Installation]] section to get started.

The main quirk is that the system has to force automatic saving of the edited Haxe File. ( [[https://github.com/AlonTzarafi/battle-haxe#big-issue][Big issue]] )

* Features
- Member completion (via [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode][company-mode]]), for example after "myObject." or "override "
- Type completion, for example after "new " or "import "
- If you auto-complete a class name, for example after "new " completion, it will automatically import the class as well
- Jump to the definition of the current symbol with a key. Press another key to go back to where you were
- Find all references of the current symbol (choose between them using [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]])
- Eldoc support
- Optionally expand method calls completions using [[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][yasnippet]].

* Big issue
- Before a compiler services action is called, the document is always automatically saved without question.
  This is because the Haxe compiler doesn't accept compiler services calls when using other (temporary) files, so for now I had Haxe process the real file path instead and had the document forcibly saved.
  This is not an issue for me at all, but if it is for you, don't use the package!

* Issues
- You MUST have a file with .hxml extension in the root project folder. (https://haxe.org/manual/compiler-usage-hxml.html)
  You must have it for the compiler to know what to check and which libraries you depend on.
  This file however does not exist in frameworks that compile your project differently (For example [[https://github.com/AlonTzarafi/battle-haxe#limeopenfl-projects][Lime/OpenFL projects]], see that section for a solution).
- This package doesn't handle multiple simultaneous projects or running multiple Haxe completion servers yet.
  If you want to switch to another project, run the ~battle-haxe-start-server~ command in the new project.

* Installation
- *First install the following packages which are required as dependencies:*
  - ~company~, ~helm~, ~async~, ~dash~, ~f~, ~s~
  - optional dependency: ~yasnippet~
- *Download this package and add it to your load path, for example:*
#+begin_src elisp
;; Tell Emacs where your elisp library sits
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/battle-haxe")
#+end_src
- *If you have [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], this is a template you can customize and insert to your init file to load the package:*
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package battle-haxe
  :mode ("\\.hx\\'" . battle-haxe-syntax-mode)
  :hook (battle-haxe-syntax-mode-hook . battle-haxe-services-mode)
  :bind (("S-<f4>" . #'pop-global-mark) ;To get back after visiting a definition
         :map battle-haxe-services-mode-map
         ("<f4>" . #'battle-haxe-goto-definition)
         ("<f12>" . #'battle-haxe-helm-find-references))
  :custom
  (battle-haxe-yasnippet-completion-expansion t "Keep this if you want yasnippet to expand completions."))
#+end_src

* Lime/OpenFL projects
The package uses the Haxe compiler directly and doesn't use Lime's "Project.xml" config file,\\
but here is a template "some-project.hxml" to get you started for this use case:
#+begin_src hxml
-cp src
-lib lime
-lib openfl
#+end_src

* Notes
- This package is intended to support only the latest and greatest Haxe compiler version (currently =4.0.0-rc.1=).
- The included battle-haxe-syntax-mode is merely a shortcut to ~js-mode~ which performs decent basic Haxe highlighting and indentation.
  (If you have a better base mode for Haxe syntax then I'd be interested to know. js2-mode for example breaks down in more advanced Haxe files.)

* Package naming
I just found it funny that the language's creator gave it the name "Haxe" but pronounces it as "Axe".
